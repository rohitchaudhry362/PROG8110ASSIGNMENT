I have created the basic chatboard where anyone can start with texting 'Hi' and then reply with the options available in CapsLock letters. The major languages for the projects are javaScript, Html5 and Css3.

You need to clone the project and then install all the dependencies using 'npm install' and then start the chatboard with command 'npm init'.


Thank You,
Rohit Chaudhry.
